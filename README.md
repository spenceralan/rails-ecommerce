# Rails Ecommerce Store

This app is unlikely to save the world. But it will help you keep track of every review you have ever left on a product (that is in this store)!

With user authentication and authorization, users can easily navigate between products and add reviews that are instantly tied to their accounts! If a user has a special admin account, they have the power to add new products and even delete user reviews!

Users will even have the option of viewing all the reviews they have left on one convenient page. Check it out in the 'Edit Account' section!

### Prerequisites

Web browser with ES6 compatibility
Examples: Chrome, Safari

Ruby 2.4.1
Bundler

### Installing

Installation is quick and easy! You can clone this repository to your machine and host it locally! 

Once it is cloned, navigate to the root of the project and run:

```shell
bundle
```

When that finishes, set up the database with the command:

```shell
bundle exec rake db:setup
```

NOTE: Due to the random seed data this step may fail validations. In the unlinkely event it fails, run the above command again.

When the database is successfully setup it is time to run the app!

```shell
bundle exec rails server
```

The default host path is http://localhost:3000


NOTE: There are two basic accounts that come along with the test database.

#### User
* username: testuser
* password: 123456

#### Admin
* username: admin
* password: admin123456
